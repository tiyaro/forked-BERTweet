# <a name="introduction"></a> BERTweet: A pre-trained language model for English Tweets

BERTweet is the first public large-scale language model pre-trained for English Tweets. BERTweet is trained based on the [RoBERTa](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/roberta/README.md)  pre-training procedure. The corpus used to pre-train BERTweet consists of 850M English Tweets (16B word tokens ~ 80GB), containing 845M Tweets streamed from 01/2012 to 08/2019 and 5M Tweets related to the **COVID-19** pandemic. The general architecture and experimental results of BERTweet can be found in our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-demos.2/):

## <a name="transformers"></a> Using BERTweet with [`transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)

### Installation <a name="install2"></a>
- Install `transformers` with pip: `pip install transformers`, or [install `transformers` from source](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#installing-from-source).  <br /> 
Note that we merged a slow tokenizer for BERTweet into the main `transformers` branch. The process of merging a fast tokenizer for BERTweet is in the discussion, as mentioned in [this pull request](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/17254#issuecomment-1133932067). If users would like to utilize the fast tokenizer, the users might install `transformers` as follows:

```
git clone --single-branch --branch fast_tokenizers_BARTpho_PhoBERT_BERTweet https://github.com/datquocnguyen/transformers.git
cd transformers
pip3 install -e .
```

- Install `tokenizers` with pip: `pip3 install tokenizers`

### <a name="models2"></a> Pre-trained models 



Model | #params | Arch. | Max length | Pre-training data
---|---|---|---|---
`vinai/bertweet-base` | 135M | base | 128 | 850M English Tweets (cased)
`vinai/bertweet-covid19-base-cased` | 135M | base | 128 | [23M COVID-19 English Tweets (cased)](https://forms.gle/sdppxWdmG7bD9rXH7)
`vinai/bertweet-covid19-base-uncased` | 135M | base | 128 | 23M COVID-19 English Tweets (uncased)
`vinai/bertweet-large` | 355M | large | 512 | 873M English Tweets (cased) 

- 09/2020: Two pre-trained models `vinai/bertweet-covid19-base-cased` and `vinai/bertweet-covid19-base-uncased` are resulted by further pre-training the pre-trained model `vinai/bertweet-base` on [a corpus of 23M COVID-19 English Tweets](https://forms.gle/sdppxWdmG7bD9rXH7).
- 08/2021: Released `vinai/bertweet-large`.

### <a name="usage2"></a> Example usage 


```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer 

bertweet = AutoModel.from_pretrained("vinai/bertweet-large")

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("vinai/bertweet-large")

# INPUT TWEET IS ALREADY NORMALIZED!
line = "DHEC confirms HTTPURL via @USER :crying_face:"

input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode(line)])

with torch.no_grad():
    features = bertweet(input_ids)  # Models outputs are now tuples
    
## With TensorFlow 2.0+:
# from transformers import TFAutoModel
# bertweet = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained("vinai/bertweet-large")
```

### <a name="preprocess"></a> Normalize raw input Tweets 

Before applying BPE to the pre-training corpus of English Tweets, we tokenized these  Tweets using `TweetTokenizer` from the NLTK toolkit and used the `emoji` package to translate emotion icons into text strings (here, each icon is referred to as a word token).   We also normalized the Tweets by converting user mentions and web/url links into special tokens `@USER` and `HTTPURL`, respectively. Thus it is recommended to also apply the same pre-processing step for BERTweet-based downstream applications w.r.t. the raw input Tweets. 

Given the raw input Tweets, to obtain the same pre-processing output, users could employ our  [TweetNormalizer](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/BERTweet/blob/master/TweetNormalizer.py) module.

- Installation: `pip3 install nltk emoji==0.6.0`
- The `emoji` version must be either 0.5.4 or 0.6.0. Newer `emoji` versions have been updated to newer versions of the Emoji Charts, thus not consistent with the one used for pre-processing our pre-training Tweet corpus. 

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from TweetNormalizer import normalizeTweet

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("vinai/bertweet-large")

line = normalizeTweet("DHEC confirms https://postandcourier.com/health/covid19/sc-has-first-two-presumptive-cases-of-coronavirus-dhec-confirms/article_bddfe4ae-5fd3-11ea-9ce4-5f495366cee6.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=user-shareâ€¦ via @postandcourier ðŸ˜¢")

input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode(line)])
```
